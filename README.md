# syriatel_customerchurn_project

This project is centered around a Telecommunications company called SyriaTel. SyriaTel is one of the two major telecommunications companies in Syria. One of the biggest issues that companies in the Telco industry have is that not all clients or customers that they gain will remain their customers. This leads to a huge loss of potential profits and thus it follows that a telco company seeking to improve their bottom line (i.e profits) will want to focus on this area.

Thats where this project comes in. Our goal was to run an analysis of the data in order to expose any uderlying factors and trends in the data that SyriaTel can create actionalable plans around. Then, to build a model that can predict that a customer is at risk of chruning before they churn.

The project is concluded with a few actionable plans and a powerpoint presentation has been included.
